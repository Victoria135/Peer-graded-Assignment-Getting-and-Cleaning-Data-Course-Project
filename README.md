This repository is a  Getting and Cleaning Data course project. It include the instructions on how to make data tidy and easy to read

Dataset
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

Files
CodeBook.md a code book explains data, variables and observations, steps to amke data tidy

run_analysis.R that does the following:
1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones.txt is the data that we get after following all 5 steps
